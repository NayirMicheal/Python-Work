If you wish to find sqrt of 10 (which is 3.14... 3 being the floor value) 
you need 2 positions start and end. We should start from 1 
(being the least possible positive square root) and for end 
( since we know that 3^2 is 9 (left part) and 4^2 is 16 (right part) 
our ans is btw them) it should be 10/2= 5 hence we'll find our answer in the range
 (1,2,3,4,5) in the beginning we have start =1 and end =5 middle will be 1+(5-1)/2 =3 
 now find (square of 3)=9 (we will ensure start is always less than or equal
 to end which is true here) since 9<10 hence we move start to (3+1)th position 
 i.e. 4 and store 3(as it may be the floor value) now (since start<end) start is
 at 4 and end is at 5 so middle is 4 now 4^4=16 which is greater than 10 hence
 end will be (3-1)=2nd position and since start(3) > end (2) we return 3 as
 
 Time complexity is O(log(n)), space is O(1)
