RouteTrieNode's time complexity and space complexity both are O(K*N).
where N is number of inputs and K is length of the average input
Space complexity is O(n) where n is number of the nodes in the trie 
RouteTrie functions complexity is O(n), space is O(1)
Router's time complexity and space complexity both for lookup and add handler is O(n).
