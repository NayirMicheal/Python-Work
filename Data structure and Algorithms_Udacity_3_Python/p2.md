at least one half of the two sub arrays is sorted
If mid happens to be the point of rotation them both left and right sub-arrays will be sorted.
 can easily know which half is sorted by comparing start and end element of each half
 Once we find which half is sorted we can see if the key is present in that half
 If the key is present in that half we dig into on that half
else we dig into on the other half using excluding so it leads to O(log(n))
space O(1) as no added arrays of other data structures
