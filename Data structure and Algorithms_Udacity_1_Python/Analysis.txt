+  Task0   +    O (1)      +   As it an element access for repeated process
+  Task1   +    O (n)      +   As it only contains one for loop
+  Task2   +    O(n^2)     +   AS it contains ine for loop O(n) and if / not in which is dependent and O(n) so it would be O(n^2) 
+  Task3   + O(n log(n))   +   AS it contains ine for loop O(n) and sorted function O(nlog(n)) so by the multiplication it would be the bigger which is O(n log(n))
+  Task4   + O(n log(n))   +   AS it contains sorted function O(n log(n)) and for each one is O(n) so the biggest would be O(n log(n))
